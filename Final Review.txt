1. Write C declarations for the following variables:
    A. An array of 10 integers initialized to 0 called arr.
        int arr[10] = {0};
    
    B. A pointer to an integer called p1. It should point to slot 6 of arr.
        int* p1 = arr[6];

    C. An array than contains 3 pointers to integers, each initialized to null. This should be called arr2.
        int* arr2 = {NULL};

    D. A pointer-to-pointer to integer which points to slot 1 of arr2. This should be called p2.
        int* p2 = arr2[2];

2. Consider the linked list code from lab 6. Write a function called deleteAlternates that deletes every other node in the linked list, beginning with
   the first. It should free each deleted node. If the linked list has items 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7, then the function should delete the items
   3, 8, and 4. When the function finishes, listPtr should contain a pointer to the Node containing 6.

    void deleteAlternates(Node ** listPtr) {
        if(listPtr->next != NULL)
        {
            listPtr->next = listPtr->next->next;
            free(listPtr->next);
            deleteAlternates(listPtr->next);
        }
    }

3. Simplify the following O-notation expressions:
    O(n^8) + O(n^18) = O(n^18)
    O[n^3 (log n)^3] + O(n^5) = O(n^5)
    O(n^3) * O(n^8) = O(n^11)
    O(23) + O(3^17) = O(3^17)
    n^5 + 3n^5 + n^7 + 8152 = O(n^7)

4. Consider the definition for a binary tree (not necessarily a binary search tree).
    typedef struct TreeTag Tree;
    struct TreeTag {
    int data;
    Tree *left;
    Tree *right;
    };

    Write a function called countGreater that counts the number of elements in the tree that are greater than or equal to a given value n. Remember – this is just a
    binary tree and not necessarily a binary search tree. 
    
    int countGreater(Tree *root, value n) {
    }

5. Draw a binary search tree of height 3 that contains the following nodes: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. This is not necessarily the order in which they are inserted.

                     |------40------|
                |---20---|     |----60
                10      30    50

6. Consider the code below.
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stddef.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <stdbool.h>

    void alpha(int *p) {
        (*p)--;
        printf("%d\n", *p);
    }

    void check(int *p) {
        printf("%d\n", *p);
        alpha(p);
    }

    int count(int a) {
        int sq = a*a;
        return sq;
    }

    int main(void) {
        int n = count(3); //9
        check(&n); 
        printf("%d\n", n);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    a. What does the code print?
      
        9
        8
        8

    b. What functions are on the program stack when alpha is executing? (leftmost is bottom of stack in answers below)
        
        e. main, check, alpha

7. Consider the queue.c and queue.h code from lab 7. Recall that this implementation is a circular queue. Assume the MAX_Q is set to 5.
Assume the following code is executed:
    Queue q = initQueue();
    enqueue(q, 4); // statement 1
    enqueue(q, 7); // statement 2
    QueueData a = dequeue(q); // statement 3
    enqueue(q, 9); // statement 4
    enqueue(q, 3); // statement 5
    QueueData b = dequeue(q); // statement 6
    QueueData c = dequeue(q); // statement 7
    enqueue(q, 8); // statement 8
    QueueData d = dequeue(q); // statement 9
    enqueue(q, 1); // statement 10

    A. Show the contents of the queue (both the array, its indices, and contents) after statement 2 has finished.
       
        array:
        Indiceds: | 0 | 1 |
        contents: | 4 | 7 |
        
    B. What is a? a = 4;

    C. Show the contents of the queue after statement 5 has finished.

        array:
        Indiceds: | 0 | 1 | 2 |
        contents: | 7 | 9 | 3 |

    D. Show the contents of the queue after statement 10 has finished.

        array:
        Indiceds: | 0 | 1  |
        contents: | 8 | 10 |

8. I want to sort an array using quicksort. The array has the following values: 45 7 28 93 77 -3 18 101
   This version of quicksort always selects the first element in the array as the pivot element. Consider the contents of the array after the partition step is 
   called, but before recursive calls to quicksort are made. Give three different orderings of this array that could be valid after partition is called:
        Ordering #1: 
        Ordering #2: 
        Ordering #3: 

9. Give the worst-case O-notation for each of the following algorithms:
    A. mergesort, data is already known to be sorted
        
        O[nlog(n)]

    B. mergesort, data is not already sorted

        O[nlog(n)]

    C. quicksort, data is already known to be sorted

        O(n)

    D. quicksort, data is not already sorted but is randomized

        O[nlog(n)]

    E. binary search tree lookup, tree is balanced

        O[log(n)]

    F. binary search tree lookup, tree is not known to be balanced

        O(n)

10. Here is a binary tree:
                 |----------K----------|
          |------H------|       |------G------|
          B------|      L       A      |------J------|
                 N                     E             F

    A. What is the postorder traversal?

        N B L H A E F J G K 

    B. What is the inorder traversal?

        B N H L K A G E J F

11. Here is a BST:


    A. Insert data 32.

        * on strach paper *

    B. Insert data 60.

        * on strach paper *

    C. Put *s near each node that is accessed when searching for data item 29.

        * on strach paper *

    D. Delete value 21 using the next successor approach. Cross out any values that are updated and cross out edges and nodes that are removed.

        * on strach paper *

12. Consider the following graph. Do depth-first traversal of the following graph starting with node A. If there is a choice, select the earliest vertex 
    in alphabetical order. Show the parent, discover/finish times.
    
    * on strach paper *

13. Do breadth-first search on the graph in #12. Start with node A. For each node, label the parent and its distance from A:

    * on strach paper *

14. We are about the insert the following elements into an empty 11-slot openaddress hash table with linear probing. What does the table look like after all items
    have been inserted?
        Ham (hash value 34)
        Butter (hash value 28)
        Jello (hash value 27)
        Jam (hash value 22)
        Burger (hash value 11)
        Salad (hash value 82)
        0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9       10

15. Find the minimum spanning tree for the graph below using Kruskal’s Algorithm. Show the ordering of the edges and determine which edges are added to the MST
    and which edges are not.



16. Provide a definition of a data structure. An example is not a definition, but may help clarify the definition.

    A data structure is way of storing data. It should be able to be search through, and maniupleted by insertion or delection of data.

17. It is important to program defensively in C. Consider the following code snippets. Is it safe to execute as-is or should more defenses be added?
    int i = 0;
    while(i < 5) {
        printf(“%s”, label);
        i++;
    }

    Safe? YES NO
    If not safe, what defenses should be added?

    printf(“%s”, argv[2]);
    Safe? YES NO
    If not safe, what defenses should be added?
